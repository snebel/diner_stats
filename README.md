####What does it do?  

*DinerStats is a seating-software/POS system built to help restaurants optimize their business. It offers a simple interface with a strong emphasis on gathering and analyzing data on customer behavior.*

*It has the functionality for a business owner to configure a restaurant with a menu, menu sections, and tables. Meals can then be created and updated in real time. DinerStats calculates various statistics on revenue, meal duration, number of diners, individual tables, individual menu items, and individual menu sections. D3.js, tables, and modals are used to visualize relevant metrics, which can be filtered by time.*

####How do I use it?
* The site is currently configured to root to an example restaurant set up for demonstration purposes. Feel free to click around and explore.
* Meals are created by clicking the 'Seat Table' link and selecting a number of diners.
* Menu Items can be added to a meal by selecting items from the menu on the left and clicking 'Add Items'. Click 'End Meal' when a meal is finished.
* The 'View Stats' page contains a table of meal-statistics for all meals in the specified timeframe. Individual menu items and tables are clickable to view further information.
* The graph at the bottom of the page visualizes the percent of total revenue in the specified timeframe each elemnt on the x-axis is responsible for. You can set the category of the x-axis to be either menu items, menu sections, or tables.
